Usage
=====

Basic usage
-----------

Run ognon with 

::

 $ python -m ognon

Then go to http://localhost:40460/ with a modern browser (I use Firefox 61)

What is it happening ?
----------------------

Ognon prints out some information :

::

 +------------+
 | Ognon v1.Î± |
 +------------+
 Working on file:///home/leon/ognons/
 Serving on http://localhost:40460
 Serving on osc://localhost:50460

We got :

- The Ognon version
- The location on your computer where ognon saves and exports files
- The adress where the http server is serving
- The adress where the osc server is serving

If you browse the http adress (e.g. with firefox), you will find the *web interface*. This is where you can edit and manage your projects.

You can now see the guide to the web interface -> :ref:`ognonWebInterface`.

Advanced command line options
------------------------------

- ``$ python -m ognon --help`` : get the help
- ``$ python -m ognon --test`` : run the tests (pytest)
- ``$ python -m ognon --browse`` : open a web browser at the server adress
- ``$ python -m ognon --no-osc`` : do not start the osc server

Server API usage
----------------

POST requests can be sent to the ognon server. data are sent and received in JSON.

Paths
^^^^^

The server will look into ognon to find a function corresponding to the path

::

    POST /path/to/function/

the two kinds of functions that must be used are `/control/controller/function/` and `/view/function/`. 

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

When a request is sent to the server, two parameters can be passed. They are both optional.

- `cursor` (string) : the id of the cursor to be used. (default is 'default')
- `args` (object) : the args to be passed to the function. Keys are arguments names, values are arguments values. Can be ommited if the function take no other args than the cursor. 


Example
^^^^^^^
To draw a line on the cell curently pointed by the cursor 'default'.

.. code-block:: javascript

	POST /control/drawer/draw
	{
		cursor:'default',
		args:{
			x1:23,
			x2:54
			y1:23,
			y2:54
		},
	}


OSC Server usage
----------------

Ognon run two servers at the same time. The HTTP server (that is used in the web interface to get pages and to post requests) and the OSC server. The OSC server expects roughly the same types of requests than the POST handler of the HTTP server. But since the OSC protocole is simpler than HTTP, it will do less.

See -> http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_0

The Ognon OSC server should be able to handle requests on any *control function*. The request adress should be the path to the *control function* and a cursor id must be passed as a first argument.


Paths
^^^^^
The server will look into ognon to find a control function corresponding to the path

::

    /control/<module>/<function>

For a complete list of *control functions* see this link : :class:`ognon.control`

Cursor id
^^^^^^^^^

For the cursor id you may want to use ``default``.

Server port
^^^^^^^^^^^

The new default port to the Ognon OSC server is ``50460`` (``5005`` in Ognon v0)

Example
^^^^^^^

To run the animation (``/step`` in Ognon v0)

:: 
 /control/navigator/run default

To go to the first frame of the animation (``/reset`` in Ognon v0)

:: 
 /control/navigator/go_to_first_frm default

To play/pause the animation

:: 
 /control/navigator/play default

To select the 'dance-of-robots' animation 

:: 
 control/animsmanager/select_anim default dance-of-robots
