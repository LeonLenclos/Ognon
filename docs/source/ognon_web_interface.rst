Ognon web interface
===================

.. warning:: The web interface of Ognon is not yet properly documented. This short draft may not be very useful.

The web interface is the main user interface of Ognon. When Ognon is running, it is accessible through a browser (its default address is http://localhost:40460)

It consists of different pages, the one you will use the most (and the first one that opens) is **Ognon - Edit** (``/edit.html``)

The other pages are :

* **Ognon - See** (``/see.html``): which allows you to have a clean view of the animation.
* **Ognon - About** (``/about.html``): which is not very useful.
* **Ognon - Help** (``/help.html``): whose main purpose is to give a link to this page.

On the Ognon - Edit page, you can find, from top to bottom :

* A menu bar
* A toolbar
* A timeline
* A canvas to draw
* A status bar
